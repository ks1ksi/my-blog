25년 졸업자를 대상으로 하는 채용 연계형 인턴이다. SA 포지션이라 개발 직군은 아니고 기술영업? 느낌이다. 아마존에서 어떻게 일하는지 궁금해서 지원하게 되었다. 


## DESCRIPTION

Are you passionate about collaborating with technology and business leaders to deliver cloud-based solutions?  
  
At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are working to be the most customer-centric company on earth. To get there, we need exceptionally talented, bright, and driven people. Amazon is continually evolving and is a place where motivated employees thrive and also where employee ownership and accountability lead to meaningful results.  
  
Amazon is a place where builders can build. Our internships offer exceptional opportunities for you to grow your technical and non-technical skills. From day one, you will be working with experienced engineers who love what they do.  
Are you ready to embrace the challenge? Come build the future with us.  

### Associate Solutions Architect Intern  
  
The Solutions Architects (SA) organization is a diverse team that focuses on helping customers build infrastructures and applications at scale using AWS solutions. Our solutions architects are passionate technologists with technical breadth and depth coupled with strong interpersonal skills.  
  
As an SA intern, you will receive AWS technical training, immerse yourself in cloud computing, develop business acumen, presentation delivery, and learn more about Amazon culture. You will work on technical projects both individually and in groups, complete the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, and attend professional development events.  
  
Upon successful completion of the internship program, select interns will receive a full-time offer to join as an Associate Solutions Architect (which includes a six-month training program, known as AWS Tech U), after completion of their degree program.  
Amazon internships are full-time (40 hours/week) and normally run for 12 consecutive weeks. 
  
Inclusive Team Culture  
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.  
  
Work/Life Harmony  
Our team puts a high value on work-life harmony. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfilment AND WE encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.  
  
Mentorship & Career Growth  
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

## Assessment

![[AWS Korea Associate Solutions Architect Internship 채용연계형 인턴 지원 후기-1717142288967.jpeg]]

Resume를 작성해서 제출하면, Online Assessment를 하라고 메일이 날아온다. 코딩 테스트는 아니고 객관식 문제를 풀어야 한다.

크게 2가지 파트로 나뉜다. 첫 번째 파트는 Amazon의 LP에 얼마나 부합하는지, 일반적인 기업의 인성검사와 유사한 시험이고, 두 번째 파트는 기술적으로 얼마나 잘 알고 있는지 확인하는 객관식 시험이다. 평소 CS공부를 열심히 했다면 어느 정도는 풀 수 있지만, 지엽적인 내용도 많이 나온다. 

나는 몇문제 몰라서 찍었는데 통과했다. 

## Interview

3월 말에 Assessment 제출했는데 5월 초에 인터뷰 일정이 잡혔다. 오래 걸린다. 

사실 연락이 없어서 떨어진 줄 알고 있었는데 5월에 국제전화가 걸려와서 인터뷰 일정을 잡자고 했다. 보통은 잘 안 받는데 혹시나 해서 받았더니 아마존 리크루터였다. 

1차는 기술 면접 2차는 인성(LP) 면접이다. 둘 다 Amazon의  Leadership Principles에 맞춰서 대답해야 좋다고 한다. 
### Leadership Principles
We use our Leadership Principles every day, whether we’re discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on the best way to solve a problem. It’s just one of the things that makes Amazon peculiar.

- Customer Obsession
    
    Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
    
- Ownership
    
    Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
    
- Invent and Simplify
    
    Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
    
- Are Right, A Lot
    
    Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
    
- Learn and Be Curious
    
    Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
    
- Hire and Develop the Best
    
    Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
    
- Insist on the Highest Standards
    
    Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
    
- Think Big
    
    Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
    
- Bias for Action
    
    Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
    
- Frugality
    
    Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
    
- Earn Trust
    
    Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
    
- Dive Deep
    
    Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
    
- Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
    
    Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
    
- Deliver Results
    
    Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
    
- Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer
    
    Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.
    
- Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
    
    We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

이런 식으로 인터뷰어가 누구인지 알려준다. 링크드인에 들어가서 인터뷰어의 경력을 확인하고, 어떤 질문이 들어올 지 예상할 수 있다.

그랬어야 했는데..

내 인터뷰어는 ML 전공하신 분이었고, 최근에는 LLM, RAG 관련해서 발표도 하셨다. LLM 관련 깊은 질문을 받아 대답을 잘 하지 못했다. 또 아마존은 데이터 기반 의사 결정을 좋아하는데 그쪽으로도 잘 대답하지 못한 것 같아서 아쉽다.

아쉽게 탈락했지만 면접 경험이 굉장히 좋았기 때문에 후회는 없다.
